I did Inktober this year (2025). It was fun! I used to draw a lot as a kid and wasn’t half bad at it. Unfortunately, it’s a skill I’ve let atrophy over the years. Still, I enjoyed doing these and some of them I’m even quite proud of.

You can definitely tell that after the first few days I realised they were taking me way too long and settled on a far simpler theme.

They were all drawn on an iPad using [Linea Sketch](https://linea-app.com) by The Iconfactory, which is a nice app that doesn’t overwhelm you with options. It has a few little bugs under iPadOS 26’s new multitasking features, but it sounds like an update is in the works.
