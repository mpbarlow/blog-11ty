  <section><p>I did Inktober this year (2025). It was fun! I used to draw a lot as a kid and wasn’t half bad at it. Unfortunately, it’s a skill I’ve let atrophy over the years. Still, I enjoyed doing these and some of them I’m even quite proud of.</p>
<p>You can definitely tell that after the first few days I realised they were taking me way too long and settled on a far simpler theme.</p>
<figure class="gallery"><div class="thumbnails feed-exclude"><a href="#lightbox-image-0" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/1-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital drawing of a man’s face. He has thick, bushy auburn eyebrows and a long beard, and an absurdly large handlebar moustache. He is wearing aviator sunglasses. A lit cigarette hangs from his mouth. The image is captioned “1. Moustache”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-1" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/2-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital painting of a huge creature lumbering across a dark moor. It&apos;s ghostly white, and its arms and legs split into multiple tentacle-like appendages which wrap and weave around each other. Its legs and one arm are buried into the ground, as if to provide stability, while one arm is lifted higher revealing the ends of the appendages are sharp and claw-like. Mist surrounds the base of the creature, while its shapeless upper body reaches high enough to be in the clouds. Many small, yellow eyes can be seen through the darkness. In the foreground, looking up at the creature, stands the tiny silhouette of a person wielding a sword. The image is captioned “2. Weave”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-2" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/3-thumb.jpeg" alt="A simple, cartoonish digital drawing of a gold crown inlayed with jewels of different shapes and colours. The image is captioned “3. Crown”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-3" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/4-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital painting of the silhouette of a broken submarine lying deep in the sea. Its back half has broken away, the front half perched between two jutting rocks. A great white shark can be seen swimming nearby, tiny in comparison. Little detail can be seen besides shapes in the darkness. The image is captioned “4. Murky”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-4" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/5-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoonish digital drawing of the head and upper body of a deer in the green background of a forest. The image is captioned “5. Deer”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-5" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/6-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoonish digital drawing of a short sword piercing a crumpled can of Coca-Cola. The image is captioned “6. Pierce”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-6" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/7-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon drawing of a silly shark “standing” with its fins outstretched and its belly towards the camera, such that with its head it forms the shape of a star. Only the shark’s gills, mouth, and nostrils can be seen at the angle. The image is captioned “7. Starfish”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-7" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/8-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital drawing of a large milkshake topped with a mountain of whipped cream and a cherry. A red-and-white striped straw sticks out of the cream, and chocolate syrup is lining the inside of the cup. Next to it, on its side, is an empty bottle of Lactaid. The image is captioned “8. Reckless”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-8" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/9-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon drawing of an elephant in yellow roller skates, with its arms outstretched for balance and its tail blowing behind it in the breeze. The image is captioned “9. Heavy”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-9" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/10-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital sketch of a woman wearing blue clothes, mid-leg sweep on a man wearing orange, who is tumbling backwards with his arms outstretched. The image is captioned “10. Sweep”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-10" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/11-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon drawing of a comically large and rotund bumblebee with a big smile on his face, holding a red bass guitar between his two frontmost legs. The image captioned “11. Sting”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-11" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/12-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital painting of a skateboarder grinding a railing. He is wearing a red cap, grey shirt, blue jeans, and red trainers. His back is facing the viewer and his left arm is held out for balance. The image is captioned “12. Shredded”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-12" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/13-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon drawing of a wine glass filled with red wine. The image is titled “13. Drink”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-13" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/14-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital drawing of a pair of swimming trunks. The left half of the trunks are filled in blue with a palm tree pattern, while the right half is just a dotted outline. The image is captioned “14. Trunk”, with an “s” crossed out after."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-14" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/15-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital painting of a brown teddy bear. He has an eyepatch, a patch sewn into his elbow, and a stitched-up scar on his belly. The image is captioned “15. Ragged”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-15" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/16-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon drawing of a Victoria sponge cake, with cream and jam and a strawberry on top. Across the top is sprinkled what looks like powdered sugar, but next to the cake an overturned shaker labelled “salt”. The image is captioned “16. Blunder”.
"></a><a href="#lightbox-image-16" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/17-thumb.jpeg" alt="A simple drawing of an ornate oval mirror with gold adornment. Faintly visible in the glass, as if written with a finger in steam, are the words “your face here” in a cursive script. The image is captioned “17. Ornate”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-17" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/18-thumb.jpeg" alt="Two playing cards and a small stack of blue poker chips sit on the green felt of a poker table. The image is captioned “18. Deal”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-18" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/19-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital drawing of a polar bear standing on a glacier. The bear takes up most of the frame, with a clear blue sky and a dark sea visible behind. It’s not a very good drawing, but this one is my favourite. The image is captioned “19. Arctic”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-19" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/20-thumb.jpeg" alt="A cartoon version of the battle screen from the early Pokémon games. The player character Red is in the foreground facing away from the viewer, while Blue stands opposite looking smug and throwing up a peace sign. The text area reads “BLUE wants to fight!”.

Rivals” where the trainers’ Pokéballs would normally be displayed."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-20" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/21-thumb.jpeg" alt="The words “KA POW” are in grey 3D block text with a cartoon explosion between them.

Button”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-22" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/23-thumb.jpeg" alt="A very, very bad attempt to draw the front of Serenity, the spaceship from the TV show Firefly. The actual spaceship is quite cool, but my drawing looks more like an injured metal bird. The image is captioned “23. Firefly”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-23" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/24-thumb.jpeg" alt="A drawing of Rowdy Roddy Piper as he appears in the movie They Live. He is wearing sunglasses, a bandolier, and a blue chequered shirt. The image is captioned “24. Rowdy”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-24" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/25-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital painting of a small fire sprite—a flame with two large eyes in the centre.

Inferno”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-25" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/26-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital drawing of a jigsaw puzzle piece with stick-figure-like arms and legs. The top of the puzzle piece looks like a head, and the arms are performing a shrugging gesture. The image is captioned “26. Puzzling”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-26" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/27-thumb.jpeg" alt="A digital coloured pencil drawing of a white onion. It’s just an onion so there’s not much to tell, but I really like the shading on this one. The image is captioned “27. Onion”."></a><a href="#lightbox-image-27" title="Enlarge image"><img src="/img/inktober2025/28-thumb.jpeg" alt="A drawing of a dancing skeleton wearing a top hat and holding a cane horizontally.

<p>They were all drawn on an iPad using <a href="https://linea-app.com">Linea Sketch</a> by The Iconfactory, which is a nice app that doesn’t overwhelm you with options. It has a few little bugs under iPadOS 26’s new multitasking features, but it sounds like an update is in the works.</p>
