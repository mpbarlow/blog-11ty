A cartoon version of the battle screen from the early Pokémon games. The player character Red is in the foreground facing away from the viewer, while Blue stands opposite looking smug and throwing up a peace sign. The text area reads “BLUE wants to fight!”. The image is captioned “20. Rivals” where the trainers’ Pokéballs would normally be displayed.
