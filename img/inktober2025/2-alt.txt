A digital painting of a huge creature lumbering across a dark moor. It's ghostly white, and its arms and legs split into multiple tentacle-like appendages which wrap and weave around each other. Its legs and one arm are buried into the ground, as if to provide stability, while one arm is lifted higher revealing the ends of the appendages are sharp and claw-like. Mist surrounds the base of the creature, while its shapeless upper body reaches high enough to be in the clouds. Many small, yellow eyes can be seen through the darkness. In the foreground, looking up at the creature, stands the tiny silhouette of a person wielding a sword. The image is captioned “2. Weave”.
