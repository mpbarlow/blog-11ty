A digital painting of the silhouette of a broken submarine lying deep in the sea. Its back half has broken away, the front half perched between two jutting rocks. A great white shark can be seen swimming nearby, tiny in comparison. Little detail can be seen besides shapes in the darkness. The image is captioned “4. Murky”.
