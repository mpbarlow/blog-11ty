> The reason I'm so onerously explaining this is that I do not believe the majority of people hate technology, but what the technology industry has become in search of growth. In fact, I'd argue that deep down, many people love technology â€” we love that we can instantly connect to friends using little computers in our pockets, or that we can share photos or videos with effectively anyone with an internet connection. As "one of big tech's angriest critics," I must confess I absolutely love what I can do with the computer, as deep down I'm a brokenhearted romantic that can see, beneath all the slop, growth and bullshit are many, many things I truly, deeply love.

It's a long read, but god damn. It sums up exactly the sadness and loathing I feel about modern software.
